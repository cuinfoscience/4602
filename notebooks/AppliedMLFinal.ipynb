    "\n",
    "Did you form an interesting, original and creative question, and explain why it is important to answer that question? \n",

    "3. __Presentation__. _(5 points)_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you do a good job presenting your results? Would your notebook make sense to a person who was not familiar with your project? You should take time to write clearly, simplify your code and explain what you are doing in your notebook. Make sure your plots are well-labeled and appropriately scaled. "

    "## Original question [instructions] \n",
    "\n",
    "_Unlike in the midterm project, for the final project you will be asked for formulate and answer an original question. As before, you should take time to explain why this question matters and how it fits with existing understanding of your topic. An original question is a question that you come up with on your own, rather than a question that is formulated for you. For instance, downloading a dataset from Kaggle and predicting the labels provided in the dataset is not asking an original question because Kaggle contributors have already defined the task for you._\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are stuck, here are some strategies for finding original questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You might take an existing analysis and offer a new twist. For instance, you might start with a dataset used for [predicting the winners of NBA games](https://github.com/JakeKandell/NBA-Predict) and instead cluster the data to see if you can identify blowouts (when one a team wins by a lot). \n",
    "2. You might compare datasets in new ways. For instance, you might test if features that are good for predicting NBA games are also good for predicting NFL games, and then investigate why you might observe a difference.\n",
    "3. You might apply your own knowledge of a subject to ask a new question. For instance, if you know a lot about minor league baseball, this might help you ask interesting and original questions that others have not thought of before.\n",
    "4. Modify or expand existing work. You might start with a blog post or paper that shares data, and then extend or modify the existing study.\n",
    "5. Systematically analyze errors in an existing analysis. You might start with a blog post or paper that shares data, and then revisit and rexamine some of the questions with empirical tests using code to see if the author overlooked certain angles or drew unsubstantiated conclusions."
