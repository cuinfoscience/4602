\subsection{Diversity, equity and inclusion}
CMCI strives to be a community whose excellence depends on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We aim to understand and challenge systems of privilege and disadvantage in higher education, such as those based on class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and dis/ability. We seek to reach across social and political divides and to make space for voices historically underrepresented in higher education and marginalized in society. In other words, diversity is not just a future reality for which we try to prepare students. It is a priority we want to put into practice here, now, and together, in order to foster places of learning where all members can thrive. Our question for you is, how are we doing? Please contact the CMCI diversity team (email Lisa Flores or visit the CMCI Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Staff page) for any of the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if you need support or other resources but donâ€™t know where to turn
    \item if any aspect of your educational experience with CMCI does not reflect the commitment expressed here, or if you want to share a positive instance of this commitment in action
    \item if you have any questions, concerns, or ideas related to diversity
\end{itemize}

We want to hear from you so that we can do better, and to support you however we can!
